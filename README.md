# RedLand
The RedButton landing page project.

###Instructions
Clone the repo, make sure you have the sass gem (gem install sass) and then run the following to build:
```
npm install
npm gulp //npm gulp watch if you are developing and want it to build automatically
```

Done! Everything is compressed, minified etc inside the assets/dest folder.
Just open index.html to experience the awesome.
